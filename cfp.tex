The 30th Annual CCSC Eastern Regional Conference will be held on the campus
of York College of Pennsylvania.

York College is a small (4500+ students) comprehensive undergraduate college 
located in York, Pennsylvania, a short trip from the Baltimore/Washington D.C.\
and Philadelphia metro areas, and a few hours from the New York metro area.

The 2014 CCSC Eastern Conference is designed to promote the exchange of information among
educators at all levels of the computing sciences. The conference spans all computing disciplines,
including computer science, computational science, information systems, information technology, and
beyond; and provides an affordable regional forum for the exchange of ideas and information
concerning computing and computing curricula.

The CCSC Eastern Conference welcomes scholarly papers, presentations, workshops, posters, and
panels on all areas of computing. We especially invite submissions that are of interest to
undergraduate students and submissions on the content, structure, delivery, support, and application
context of all areas of computing education.

The conference will include workshops, invited speakers, tutorials, panels,
lightning talks, and paper sessions. Two exciting activities are planned
for students: (a) a student poster session where undergraduate and graduate students
will have the opportunity to present research projects on any topic of the computing
sciences; and (b) a student team programming competition.
Both the student poster session and programming competition will award prizes.

Based on this year's theme, {\it Building a Community}, we especially
encourage submissions related to sharing innovative curriculum
materials and pedagogical approaches across institutions and academic
progams.  However, we welcome submissions related to all areas of
computing education.
